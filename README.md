### Faith & Religious Content Disclaimer

If you include religious or faith-based content alongside other material.

> Some pages include a short scripture or faith-based quote chosen at random. These are part of my personal practice and are not meant to persuade or impose beliefs. I do write about religion from time to time because it is meaningful to me, but I aim to do so thoughtfully and respectfully toward all readers.

> Some pages display a verse or quotation selected at random from an external source. This is included for personal inspiration and is not intended as preaching or persuasion. I do not introduce religious discussion unless it is relevant or invited. I do, however, write about faith at times, and when I do, it reflects my own views.

> Some pages on this site may display a randomly selected verse or quotation from a religious text. This is included for personal inspiration and not intended as preaching or persuasion. While I occasionally write about faith and religion, such content reflects my personal perspective and is shared respectfully, not prescriptively.

> I sometimes write about politics or public affairs because they interest me. These are simply my personal thoughts and reflections, not attempts to persuade anyone or represent any institution.

> From time to time, this site may discuss political issues or current events. These posts reflect personal opinions and should not be interpreted as official statements, endorsements, or professional advice.

> This website may occasionally include commentary on political or public policy topics. Any views expressed are my own and are shared for informational and reflective purposes only. They are not intended to persuade, endorse, or oppose any political party, candidate, or organization.
